Data processing and computation requirements are getting bigger every day. Along with CPUs  and FPGAs, GPUs have come to the play in the recent years. GPUs are usually able to produce high throughput with the option of being energy efficient. Unlike CPUs, GPUs are needed to be more efficient in terms of power consumption to be considered as an accelerator in HPC systems. MODIFICATION NEEDED!!
